### üèïÔ∏èMy little software camp 

Hello. My name is Michael Keller. Born in the 1980s, I had contact with home computers such as the C64 and Amiga 500 at an early age. Later I discovered my love for SAP ERP software and the ABAP programming language. That was almost 20 years ago. Since then I've been dealing with SAP technologies both professionally and privately. Because I've high hopes for topics like open source, crowdsourcing, and a few other topics, I share a lot of my thoughts and research. My thanks go to everyone who does the same. Together into the future!
