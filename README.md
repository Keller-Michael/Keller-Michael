## üèïÔ∏è My software camp - ABAP and SAP related topics

### :raising_hand_man: About me

Hello. My name is [Michael Keller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-keller-abap-developer/). Born in the 1980s, I had contact with home computers such as the [C64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) and [Amiga 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) at an early age. Later I discovered my passion for [SAP ERP software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP) and the [ABAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP) programming language. That was almost 20 years ago. Since then I've been dealing with SAP technologies both professionally and privately. Because I've high hopes for topics like [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), [crowdsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing), and a few other topics, I share a lot of my thoughts and research results. My thanks go to everyone who does the same. Together into the future!

Ok, no big surprise here on my GitHub profile :wink: But before starting with ABAP, I had serious fun with Basic, Turbo Pascal, Assembler, Visual Basic, Delphi, C, C# and Java.
